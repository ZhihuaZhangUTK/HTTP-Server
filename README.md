# HTTP-Server

The goal is to implement a basic HTTP server that supports directory listing, static files, and CGI scripts. 
The server needs to run on a Linux server environment, such as those supported in our lab machines. 
Additionally, you will also have to write a sample CGI shell script that can be executed by your web server.
